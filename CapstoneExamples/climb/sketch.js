// The 1000M Climb
// Adam Abouelela
// June 24, 2024

/*
This game was inspired by Celeste (PICO-8).
Your goal is to climb a trecherous mountain to the 1000m peak.
For each 100m you climb, you must clear one screen. In order to clear a screen, you need to reach the top of the window.
To aid you with your climb, you have a special 8-way dash ability that allows you to rush in a straight line in any of 8 directions for a short period of time.
You only have one dash, that can be recharged by touching the ground.
While dashing you are incapable of moving, except for jumping, which grants you a major horizontal speed boost when interrupting your dash.
Interrupting a downwards diagonal dash grants you even more speed at the cost of losing some of the jump height.
You are also able to slide on walls and wall jump when you are next to a wall (not on the ground).
With these skills you must clear a total of 10 screens to reach the summit.
The time it takes you to reach the summit, as well as your death toll, will be shown to you at the end.
Good luck!
